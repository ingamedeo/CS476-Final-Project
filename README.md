# Programming Language Design Project (CS476)
_Instructor: William Mansky_

## TODO list
* [x] Figure out how the binding works (From C/C++ to LLVM IR to OCaml)
* [ ] Convert paper syntax to ocaml
* [ ] Look at LLVM source, learn some optimizations
* [ ] Implement those optimizations in OCaml
* [ ] Prove (either on paper or using Coq) that those optimizations are correct from a formal standpoint
